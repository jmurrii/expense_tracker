## Summary

In the Sixth exercise of Andy Sterkowitz' Software Development Mastermind Program, I was given the task of creating an Expense Tracker application.
In completing the project I continued to learn about how to manipulate the dom, specifically how to add and delete information to/from a table element dynamically with Javascript.
